# Cloud Computing Foundations and Models 🌐💻

## Cloud Computing Definition

- Enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
- Shared pool of resources can be configured, provisioned rapidly, and released with minimal effort.
- Follows a pay-as-you-go model.

## Essential Characteristics

1. On-Demand Self-Service 🔄🚀
2. Broad Network Access 🌐💼
3. Resource Pooling 🔄💽
4. Rapid Elasticity ⚡📈
5. Measured Services 📊💵

## Service Models

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**

   - Access to provider's applications over a network.
   - Examples: Google Docs, Spreadsheets.

2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**

   - Provisioning of processing, storage, and networks.
   - Example: Amazon EC2.

3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - Providing platforms for development and testing.
   - Examples: Microsoft Azure.

## Deployment Models

1. **Private Cloud:**

   - Built and used within a single organization.
   - Example: Meghamala at IIT Kharagpur.

2. **Public Cloud:**

   - Available to the general public.
   - Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS).

3. **Hybrid Cloud:**

   - Mix of public and private clouds.

4. **Community Cloud:**
   - Shared by organizations with common goals.
   - Example: Banking cloud.

## Virtualization

- Allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.
- Hypervisors like Xen and VMware play a crucial role.
