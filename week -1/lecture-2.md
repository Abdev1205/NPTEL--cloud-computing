# Overview of Computing and Evolution to Cloud ☁️

## Distributed Systems

- **Why?**
  - Nature of Applications: Computing or data-intensive tasks.
  - Performance: Driving force for distributed systems.

## Robustness

- No Single Point of Failure 🚫💥
- Tasks can be executed on other nodes in case of failure.

## Types of Distributed Applications

- Collaboration among processes to solve common problems.

## Motivations

- Client-Server Paradigm 🖥️🔄
- Peer-to-Peer Computing 👥

## Distributed Computing Paradigms

- **Grid Computing:** Uses idle computers to solve intensive problems.
- **Cluster Computing:** Collection of interconnected computers for reliability.
- **Utility Computing:** On-demand resources with a pay-as-you-go model.

## Utility Computing Characteristics

- Metered Service ⚖️
- On-Demand Cyber Infrastructure 🌐💻

## Challenges

- Data Backup 📂💾
- Competence Issues 💼🤔
- Security 🔒

## Cloud Computing Definition (NIST)

- Ubiquitous Access to Configurable Resources 🌐🛠️
- Rapid Provisioning and Release ⚡🔄

## Conclusion

Cloud computing is a transformative model, evolving from distributed systems to utility computing. In future lectures, we'll explore the various aspects, advantages, and disadvantages of cloud computing.
